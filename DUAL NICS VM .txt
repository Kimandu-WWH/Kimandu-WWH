DUAL NICS VM 
different Port-groups
L2 Loops can occur under certain configuration 
Control plane vs Data Plane 
--  Data Plane is  still vulnerable from Loops
-- Disable MCP on certain interfaces / or       ports
 
Either scaling horizontally - caps at 250 per ports
I don't want you to bridge VM's in this environment
Non standard - configuration -  on the P&T.
